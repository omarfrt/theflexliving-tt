This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the Json-Server server:

```bash
npm run server
# or
yarn run server
# or
pnpm run server
# or
bun run server
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

And Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result of the Json-server Api if you want.

## ps
All the data is manupilated with in the application state.
